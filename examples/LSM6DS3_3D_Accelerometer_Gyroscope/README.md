# LSM6DS3 3D Accelerometer Gyroscope example sketch

This example sketch initializes the LSM6DS3 sensor, prints to the serial monitor what ranges and data rates the accelerometer and gyroscope are set to, and prints the values of temperature, X, Y and Z accelerations and X, Y and Z rotations every 200 ms.
